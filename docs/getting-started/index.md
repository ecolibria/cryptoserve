# Getting Started

Welcome to CryptoServe! This section will help you get up and running quickly.

## Overview

CryptoServe is a cryptography-as-a-service platform that provides:

- **Server** — FastAPI backend that handles all cryptographic operations
- **Dashboard** — Next.js web interface for identity and context management
- **SDKs** — Personalized client libraries with embedded identity

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (recommended for quick start)
- Or: **Python 3.11+** and **Node.js 18+** for local development
- A **GitHub account** for OAuth authentication

## Quick Navigation

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **[Installation](installation.md)** | Multiple installation methods: Docker, local development, or cloud deployment |
| **[Quick Start](quickstart.md)** | Create your first identity and encrypt data in 5 minutes |
| **[Configuration](configuration.md)** | Environment variables, OAuth setup, and production settings |

## Recommended Path

1. **Start with [Installation](installation.md)** — Get the server running
2. **Follow the [Quick Start](quickstart.md)** — Create an identity and test encryption
3. **Review [Configuration](configuration.md)** — Customize for your environment
4. **Read the [Concepts](../concepts/index.md)** — Understand the architecture
